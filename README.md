## Curated Collection of High-Quality Prompts for Google's Veo3 Video Generation Model


Tips for prompt words:
1) Picture: clearly identify the protagonist (as detailed as possible), scene, action, style, and desired special effects
2) Sound effects: speech, sound effects, music, sound texture and size
3) The prompt words must be in English, which can be done with Gemini 2.5

+ Create a base prompt
+ Iterate small elements

BASE PROMPT STRUCTURE:
[PERSPECTIVE], [SHOT STYLE + DETAILS], [SUBJECT DETAILS + ENVIRONMENT], [SCENE DETAILS], [SOUND DESCRIPTION], [LIGHTING], [FILM STYLE]



So I analysed a couple of hundred Veo 3 prompts and their outputs and here's what I found
>  You have to think like a directorüé¨ not just a describerüó£Ô∏è, Using terms like the "dolly zoom" wide shot and setting the tone with things like "90s VHS footage" or "documentary style"
> Be hyper-specificü§è with characters and scenes. Instead of "a man", describe his clothes, his expression, and the "moody lighting" of the room he's in. The more detail the better
> Instruct the soundüîä You can literally write dialogue in the prompt like a script (Guy: "whoa" *excited with tears in their eyes*) and tell it what kind of music to play
>  Structure your prompts like a mini-story, use words like "first...", "then...", "followed by..." or even just use numbers


[Animal Name/Type] [performs a specific, dynamic sporting action].
This cinematic, [Shot Type, e.g., slow-motion, dynamic tracking shot] is set inside a [Detailed Venue Description, e.g., professional basketball arena]. The venue features [Key Environmental Details, e.g., a polished court, bright overhead lights, and a cheering crowd]. The air is filled with the sounds of [describe key sounds, e.g., sneakers squeaking on the court, the roar of the crowd, and the animal's determined grunt]. The [Animal Name/Type], wearing [Specific Gear/Attire, e.g., a numbered jersey and tiny sneakers], shows an expression of [Specific Emotion, e.g., intense concentration]. The camera captures the moment it [Describes the detailed movement, e.g., leaps into the air with incredible power], showcasing its [Key Attribute, e.g., surprising grace or raw strength]. The [Lighting Description, e.g., dramatic spotlights] highlight [Final visual details, e.g., the tension in its muscles and the determined look in its eyes].


ASMR video, [scenes, such as close-up/mid-range/macro/overhead]. A [anchor's appearance and demeanor description, such as a beautiful young woman with long flowing hair/an elegant looking lady] wearing [clothing description, such as a silk textured camisole skirt/black lace top], in a [scene environment and atmosphere, such as a softly lit bedroom/comfortable study/dark minimalist style room].
A description of a microphone, such as a professional studio microphone/retro condenser microphone, is placed in the position of the microphone, such as in front of her/very close to the action.
She is interacting with [descriptions of core ASMR props, such as: a large bubble wrap/a white solid soap/a leather covered diary]. She interacts with props through specific actions, such as slowly bursting every bubble with her fingers, carefully peeling off thin soap flakes, and slowly writing on paper with a pen. The visual focus of the camera is on the main focal points of the image, such as her hands and props/the texture of the soap/the point of contact between the pen tip and the paper.
[Audio Description]
A broadcaster's tone and tone, such as a gentle and sweet female whisper/a deep and calm whisper/a breath full of intimacy, said, "[Specific oral content, such as: 'Let's pinch them together'/'Listen to this gentle scraping sound']
Next is a detailed description of the core ASMR sound effects, using onomatopoeia and adjectives such as the crisp and loud "pop!" sound when bubbles are pinched, the crisp and grainy sound when a blade scrapes over soap, and the unique, slightly scraping "sand" sound when a pen writes on paper.


ASMR video of slicing a glass strawberry: From an extreme macro viewpoint, a flawlessly transparent, hyper-detailed glass strawberry sits on a warmly lit wooden cutting board.
 The camera gently pushes in and out, capturing iridescent highlights and rainbow refractions dancing across its surface. Angles alternate between overhead and 45-degree side shots, freezing the exact moment the knife meets the brittle ‚Äúfruit‚Äù and revealing delicate internal striations. 
Each slow, deliberate cut releases a crisp ding‚Äîthe fragile chime of shattering glass‚Äîfollowed by the soft clatter of tiny shards and the low, resonant scrape of steel against wood, layering a rich ASMR soundscape in an otherwise hushed room. 
Composition follows the rule of thirds, with the strawberry anchored at a golden-ratio point; the background melts into a dreamy bokeh of warm light and floating dust motes. Overall, the palette is clear and serene, immersing viewers in the mesmerizing textures of glass fracturing and the intimate, crystalline sound of every slice.


A large, friendly yeti in his 30s, covered in thick white fur with icy-blue undertones, wearing a stylish ‚ÄúBefamoos‚Äù cap tilted slightly backward. He has a relaxed, mischievous smile and expressive eyes, dressed in a cozy snow jacket half-zipped. He holds a smartphone, filming himself vlog-style. The setting is a snowy northern mountain landscape, with pine trees in the background, soft snow falling, and cold wind sounds in the air. He speaks casual, chill-toned English directly to the camera: ‚ÄúYo, it‚Äôs wild out here‚Ä¶ but guess what? I found love thanks to this AI photo app called Befamoos. Look at this pic!‚Äù (He flashes his phone showing an epic AI-generated photo.) ‚ÄúPut this on YeTinder and boom ‚Äî 87 matches. Not bad for a snow beast, huh?‚Äù Natural lighting with sun glare and subtle lens flares, backed by ambient lo-fi music. Occasional close-up shots, snow crunching underfoot, and a light-hearted, influencer-vibe atmosphere.

Create an 8-second TikTok-style comedic video set on a beach in Portugal resembling Costa da Caparica or Comporta ‚Äî wide sandy shore, soft waves, clear light, a few dunes and pine trees in the background. Time of day: mid-afternoon, golden sun. Ambient audio: soft Atlantic waves, occasional seagulls, distant Portuguese voices, light breeze ‚Äî nothing dramatic. Optional background voices should sound naturally Portuguese from Lisbon (accent lisboeta) if used ‚Äî no Brazilian or generic European accents. In the center of the frame, a relaxed man in his mid-to-late 30s lies on a towel in swim shorts and sunglasses, sipping from a small cup (e.g. caf√© ou smoothie). He‚Äôs completely chill, legs crossed, enjoying the sun with earbuds in. Behind him, a small modern house builds itself in playful fast-forward, as if it‚Äôs being assembled invisibly: wooden frame, walls, roof, windows, then a little garden touch like grass or a beach-side fence ‚Äî all completed within 4 seconds. The construction must feel smooth, light, physically plausible, and satisfying ‚Äî no chaos, no machinery, no noise. Think: visual magic, not realism. The man never reacts or looks back. As the house finishes, he just smiles subtly, sips again, and leans deeper into relaxation. At the very end (last 1 second), add a short, satisfying ‚Äúding‚Äù or tropical chime to punctuate the moment the house is complete. Optional: a tiny seagull flies across screen right at that moment for comic flair. No text, no voiceover, no phone, no app shown. Camera: fixed wide shot, slightly low angle to capture sky and house. Lighting: warm and natural, typical of Portuguese summer afternoons. Color palette: beach tones, pastel swimwear, blue sky, warm sunlight.

Create an 8-second TikTok-style cinematic video set on a clean, empty plot of land in Portugal ‚Äî dry soil, soft hills in the background, a few pine trees and red-tiled roofs visible in the distance. The light is warm, golden-hour feel (late afternoon sun). Three male construction workers, early 30s to mid-40s, walk confidently toward the camera in slow motion, shoulder to shoulder, like a synchronized team. Their gear is clean and sharp: matching reflective vests, fitted work pants, boots, and helmets ‚Äî looking competent but modern. At second 4, they approach a stylish Portuguese woman, around 35 years old, standing casually on the side. She has mid-length dark hair, wears a light, elegant summer outfit ‚Äî something modern and coastal (linen pants, sleeveless blouse, sandals, sunglasses). She looks relaxed but clearly sharp. As they meet, the man in the center gives her a casual fist bump or confident handshake, and they share a brief mutual smile. Immediately after the gesture, materials start moving in the background ‚Äî wood panels arrive, someone places a first post, action begins subtly but efficiently. No one talks. No one overacts. It‚Äôs all subtle confidence and rhythm. The video ends with a brief slow zoom-in on the group, now all turned slightly toward the camera, with just a quick knowing smile from the woman. Ambient audio: soft construction ambience (light metal clinks, gravel crunch, maybe a distant hammer), paired with a subtle rhythmic beat that hits exactly at the check moment ‚Äî like a bass hit or snare roll for punch. Camera: first part is a smooth tracking shot (walking with the team), then switch to a fixed angle for the check + action kick-off. Lighting is natural, golden, a little cinematic glow on the lens.

Create an 8-second comedic TikTok-style video set on a dusty, sunlit Portuguese construction site, resembling a traditional setting ‚Äî rough stone walls, wooden scaffolding, maybe a wheelbarrow and an old cement bag lying around. The ambient audio includes light wind, birds, and faint city or village sounds in the background. Three older Portuguese builders, all around 60‚Äì70 years old, stand in front of a half-built stone wall. They wear mismatched old construction gear: faded flannel shirts, saggy work pants, straw hats or worn-out helmets. One has a visible beer belly. One of them dramatically pulls out an ancient, yellowed bubble level, blows dust off it, shakes it a little to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the bubble, squints one eye, and carefully checks the wall. He says nothing, just nods slowly. The other two look seriously at the bubble, then nod too ‚Äî like it‚Äôs a big moment. Pure ‚Äútuga‚Äù builder energy. Just as they approve the wall‚Ä¶ a younger builder (mid-30s) enters frame from the side, in clean modern gear, gives them a small respectful nod‚Ä¶ then snaps his fingers or does a quick head nod. Instantly, behind him, a modern modular house structure starts assembling in fast-forward time-lapse ‚Äî sleek, clean, clearly efficient. The old builders turn their heads slowly toward the modern house, eyes wide, jaws slightly open. No reaction overplayed ‚Äî just deadpan surprise. End beat: comedic ‚Äúding‚Äù or cartoonish ‚Äúpop‚Äù sound as the house finishes, paired with a subtle zoom on the old man still holding the level, frozen. Camera style: handheld or lightly shaky, warm daylight. Lighting: natural, golden, nostalgic. No subtitles, no dialogue, no logos. Just visual comedy and contrast.

Create an 8-second comedic TikTok-style video set on an old, rural construction site in Portugal. The lighting is early morning or golden hour ‚Äî nostalgic and soft. Ambient sounds: birds chirping, faint breeze, maybe a distant rooster. A 70+ year-old Portuguese builder, slightly hunched, weathered face, classic workwear (tank top, suspenders, old boots), stands proudly next to a tiny stone structure ‚Äî something ridiculous like a crooked shed, a doghouse, or a one-meter-high wall. He climbs slowly onto a small wooden ladder, carrying a single terracotta roof tile in both hands, like it‚Äôs a sacred final piece. Dramatic slow motion as he places the tile, then raises his arms in triumph, wiping a tear of pride. Cut to wide shot: the structure is comically small and useless. He looks at it with deep emotion. At second 5: üëâ Hard cut or whip pan to the adjacent plot, where a full modern house finishes assembling in fast-forward: clean lines, modular style, complete with garden touches ‚Äî Litehaus-style. A young woman (30s, modern, Portuguese, client-style) stands in front of it, arms crossed, coffee in hand, watching with a calm, satisfied expression. Final beat: The old man turns his head slowly toward the house‚Ä¶ His jaw drops slightly. He lets his roof tile slip from his hand in slow motion ‚Äî comedic ‚Äúclack!‚Äù as it hits the ground. Camera: steady wide shot, slow motion at key moments (tile placement + tile drop). Audio: light natural ambiance, dramatic orchestral swell for the tile moment (tongue-in-cheek), then cut to calm, satisfying sound as the modern house appears. Lighting: warm, nostalgic first half; crisp and bright second half.

Open with a dry, dusty construction site at sunrise ‚Äî warm light, low shadows, and a bit of morning haze in the air. The camera is low to the ground, capturing dust swirling in the wind. At second 1, three Portuguese male workers in their 30s‚Äì40s walk into frame in slow motion, side by side, like a synced action team. They‚Äôre wearing clean, fitted workwear ‚Äî boots, high-vis jackets, helmets ‚Äî and carry tools casually like they own the site. Each step sends up little clouds of dust. The lighting catches them from behind, creating silhouettes with glowing edges. The framing is ultra-wide and cinematic. As they arrive at center frame (second 4‚Äì5), one of them gives a subtle head nod. Instantly, behind them, the construction begins in stylized fast-forward ‚Äî modular walls rise, materials fall into place, a house takes shape. The team stops, turns slightly toward the camera, and one of them gives a calm, confident smile or nod. Add a stylized bass-heavy sound at the moment they arrive (like a beat drop), and a satisfying ‚Äúclick‚Äù or ‚Äúwhoosh‚Äù as the build begins.

‚ÄúLitehaus Street Interview‚Äù (Vertical 9:16) Use for: TikTok / Reels Style: Natural, modern, unbranded, authentic dialogue Duration: 8 seconds A casual street interview filmed vertically on a sunny Lisbon street ‚Äî ideally on Avenida da Liberdade or a similar wide, upscale Portuguese avenue. Late afternoon light with moving traffic, people walking, and soft ambient city sounds (Portuguese chatter, birds, scooters passing). The interviewer is a confident Portuguese woman in her 30s, casually stylish, holding a plain, unbranded microphone. She looks directly at a casually dressed man in his late 30s. Slight handheld camera movement for realism. She asks, naturally, in Portuguese (Lisbon accent): ‚ÄúSe pudesses construire 30% mais barato e 40% mais r√°pido‚Ä¶ tu le fazias, ou qu√™?‚Äù He chuckles, then answers immediately and clearly: ‚ÄúClaro que sim. J√° tava a construir desde ontem.‚Äù Light natural pacing, accurate lip syncing, believable reactions. Shot feels spontaneous but clean, with realistic facial expressions and energy. No text overlays, no app or logos. Just street-level Lisbon authenticity with a punchy verbal hook.

‚ÄúLitehaus Street Interview in Lisbon‚Äù (Vertical 9:16) A casual street interview filmed vertically on a busy sidewalk in Lisbon, Portugal ‚Äî preferably on Avenida da Liberdade in the afternoon. The street is lively but not chaotic: pedestrians, soft traffic, light chatter in Portuguese, a few scooters passing. The light is golden and natural. The interviewer is a stylish, confident Portuguese woman in her 30s, wearing a casual yet modern summer outfit. She holds a plain, unbranded microphone and looks relaxed but focused. She stops a man in his late 30s, casually dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, a bit surprised but smiling. She asks clearly, in a natural Lisbon Portuguese accent: ‚ÄúSe pudesses construir 30% mais barato e 40% mais r√°pido‚Ä¶ tu le fazias, ou qu√™?‚Äù The man chuckles lightly, nods, and replies with a half-serious tone: ‚ÄúClaro que sim. J√° tava a construir desde ontem.‚Äù The camera captures accurate lip-syncing, genuine reactions, and slight handheld movement for realism. Background ambiance includes soft Lisbon city noise ‚Äî no music, no text, no logos, no visible branding. ‚úÖ Format & Style: ‚Ä¢ Vertical 9:16 (TikTok/Reels) ‚Ä¢ Natural light, light street ambience ‚Ä¢ No branding, no overlay, no product mention ‚Äî message is in the tone + reaction ‚Ä¢ Designed for an authentic, organic vibe, but delivers a Litehaus benefit clearly

A vertical 9:16 TikTok-style video shot on a sunny afternoon in Lisbon, Portugal ‚Äî on a lively city sidewalk with Portuguese cobblestone pavement, trees, and people walking by. Slight handheld movement creates realism. A confident Portuguese woman in her early 30s, wearing modern summer clothes and sunglasses, holds a plain, unbranded microphone. She smiles and asks a passing man (mid-30s, scruffy but friendly): ‚ÄúSe pudesses construir 30% mais barato e 40% mais r√°pido‚Ä¶ tu fazias, ou qu√™?‚Äù The man laughs slightly, nods, and answers quickly and clearly, looking straight at her: ‚ÄúClaro que sim. J√° tinha a chave na m√£o!‚Äù No text appears on screen. No logos or app references. Just raw audio, natural light, authentic energy, and confident delivery. The scene ends on a subtle laugh or shared smile between them.

A cinematic 16:9 nighttime scene set on a quiet, raw construction site in Portugal. A confident Portuguese woman in her 30s walks barefoot across the dusty concrete floor of an unfinished building site. She wears a flowing silk gown in beige or champagne tones. The ground is scattered with wooden beams, cables, and soft pools of candlelight from small lanterns lining her path. The camera performs a slow lateral dolly shot (left to right), following her movement as she walks with calm elegance. Behind her, a sleek modern house begins to silently assemble itself ‚Äî piece by piece ‚Äî with no visible tools or workers. The audio is minimalist: soft ambient electronic pads, distant wind, light rustling of her silk gown. At second 5, she turns her head slightly, gazes past the camera, and speaks in calm, confident Portuguese from Lisbon: ‚ÄúEu n√£o construo. Eu mando. A Litehaus constr√≥i.‚Äù No subtitles. No music track. No logos. Just natural, surreal elegance and total control.

A minimalist cinematic 16:9 close-up shot shows a single ice cube placed in a crystal-clear glass tumbler, resting on a smooth concrete surface. The scene is quiet, still, and elegant. The lighting is soft and diffused ‚Äî golden-hour light spills through a nearby window, catching the melting water and creating subtle reflections across the tabletop. As the ice cube slowly begins to melt, droplets slide down the side of the glass. Each drop that lands triggers a corresponding construction action in the background ‚Äî a wall section rises silently, a window frame appears, roof panels shift into place. The build happens rhythmically, timed exactly with each drop. The camera holds steady with a shallow depth of field: the glass is in sharp focus, while the modular home assembling in the background is softened and elegant ‚Äî subtly visible, but secondary to the metaphor. The color palette is minimalist: cool whites, soft greys, transparent blues, and warm gold reflections. The textures are crisp ‚Äî melting ice, polished glass, brushed concrete. No people are shown. No dialogue. No branding. Just implied sound: the soft plink of water droplets, the hush of ambient air, the weightless rhythm of efficiency.

A cinematic dolly shot moves gently from left to right across a quiet construction site at night. A calm, focused woman in her 30s walks steadily across the concrete foundation in soft natural fabric ‚Äî a flowing, light-toned outfit that moves subtly with each step. Her posture is upright, composed, and confident. The unfinished site is minimal and atmospheric: structural beams, partially assembled walls, and a line of small lanterns placed evenly along her path. Their warm light flickers softly across the ground. As she walks, a modern house begins to take shape in the background ‚Äî walls rising quietly, materials fitting into place with seamless motion. The lighting is soft and balanced: a cool blue night sky overhead, warm lantern tones below. The color palette includes muted grays, soft cream, and warm amber. Textures include matte concrete, brushed steel, and light fabric. As she reaches mid-frame, she glances slightly toward the camera and says, in calm, clear Portuguese (Portugal accent): ‚ÄúEu n√£o construo. Eu mando. A Litehaus constr√≥i.‚Äù No logos. No text. No visible branding. Just visual harmony, subtle transformation, and quiet confidence.

Slow forward-moving ground-level shot over sunlit cobblestones with tufts of grass peeking through. Natural ambient sounds: chirping insects, distant bird calls, soft wind. Occasional ant or beetle crawls past in focus. Macro depth of field with gentle camera glide. Peaceful, earthy mood ‚Äî nature reclaiming the cracks.

TikTok-style street interview on a sunny, crowded city street. Presenter in smart-casual with a visible "Befamoos" t-shirt and mic approaches eccentric older woman (bright mismatched clothes, giant pretzel or rubber chicken). Quick cuts, zoom-ins, vibrant colors, upbeat music. Presenter: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam! Ever heard of Befamoos?‚Äù Brenda (squinting): ‚ÄúBefa-WHO? Sounds like my cat‚Äôs poetry!‚Äù Presenter (laughing): ‚ÄúIt finds the closest perfectly ripe avocado!‚Äù Brenda: ‚ÄúDoes it also find my dentures?

3„ÄÅA high-energy rap battle between Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein on a futuristic sci-fi stage. The camera alternates between close-ups and dramatic wide shots as they diss each other with sharp lyrics. Newton, in a classic 17th-century outfit, raps with a British accent about gravity and apples. Einstein, with wild hair and a German accent, fires back about relativity and space-time. Their lip-sync is perfectly timed to the beat, and their facial expressions are intense and animated. The background pulses with neon lights and holographic equations, reacting to the rhythm. The crowd of AI-generated scientists cheers them on in sync with the music. It feels like a rap battle from another dimension.

Original:

**Scene description**   The video is a continuous, cinematic one-shot from the point of view of a free-spirited beach dog exploring a vibrant tropical island. The camera follows the natural movement of a medium-sized, athletic dog with a short, toffee-brown coat, pointed nose, alert ears, and a lean, agile frame. The dog begins its run through a bustling open-air market, zig-zagging between motorbikes, crates of fruit, and woven baskets. Local vendors and passersby react playfully as it weaves through legs and knocks over a coconut.  It barrels through the automatic doors of a brightly lit convenience store, sliding slightly on the smooth floor, skidding past snack shelves and fridges, and startling an NPC dropping a can. A quick exit out the back leads straight into a winding jungle path. The dog's breath quickens. It bounds over logs, ducks under hanging vines, and pauses briefly to sniff before bolting again toward sunlight flickering through the canopy.  The foliage breaks suddenly‚Äîrevealing a breathtaking, quiet beach. The dog charges toward the water, then slows to a trot as waves roll in. It stops at the waterline, panting, tail wagging, soaking in the breeze.  **Visual style**   Realistic, hyper-detailed 3D with tactile textures‚Äîfrom sandy paws and wet nose smudges to sun-soaked wood and dewy jungle leaves.  **Camera movement**   Low, responsive POV camera with quick darts, sudden pivots, and bounding momentum. Subtle head tilt and body roll mimic natural canine locomotion and curiosity.  **Main subject**   The island as experienced through the eyes of a curious beach dog‚Äîfree, joyful, alert to the chaos and beauty around it.  **Background setting**   A Southeast Asian tropical island with a local market, a convenience store, a dense palm-filled jungle, and a wide, golden beach. No explicit signage‚Äîeverything is conveyed through texture, color, and atmosphere.  **Lighting / Mood**   Dynamic natural light. Warm and bright in the market, cool and filtered in the jungle, then golden and open on the beach. The overall mood is playful, free, and cinematic.  **Audio cue**   Immersive diegetic sound: panting breath, padded paws on different surfaces, distant scooter engines, chatter, jungle insects, birds, a fridge hum inside the shop, crunching leaves, and eventually soft crashing waves.

MIDJOURNEY PROMPT:
epic cinematic still, massive serpent monster coiled for attack --no humans --ar 16:9 --profile i1k9zeq  --s 400

VEO3 PROMPT:
The camera crash-zooms toward the enormous, obsidian-scaled serpent as it coils aggressively in the arid canyon. Its muscles ripple under thick armor-like skin, building tension as it prepares to strike. The perspective shifts rapidly, pulling the viewer closer until they‚Äôre face-to-face with the creature. With a final, violent lurch, the serpent opens its massive jaws in a deafening, guttural roar, fangs glistening, breath steaming, filling the frame in an uncomfortably intimate close-up that feels like it's about to burst from the screen.


prompt: flying car depicted in a Futuristic Neon Sprint, racing through a high-tech cityscape with glowing trails. Utilize luminous neon green and yellow to highlight speed and modernity


Sample prompt: A crowded cantina lounge bar bathed in the eerie purple glow of a binary sunset on a distant, alien planet. A grizzled space cowboy, his face weathered, walks over and sits at a worn bar, his hand resting on a blaster. Beside him, a towering terrifying ugly alien creature with scales and glowing eyes stares into the middle distance. Cut to a close up of The cowboy as he turns to the alien, a hint of menace in his voice, and says, "What the hell are you looking at?". Then cut to a reverse Close up of the alien as he slowly swivels its head, its voice a low rumble, and he replies, "A whole lot of nothing!". This captures a moment of tense, intergalactic standoff.

an anime scene, two mages have a conversation about the dangers of casting spells that undo death, the scene is set in a busy Tokyo cafe, exceptional acting with intensity ‚Äì award winning animation and performances (definitely not dry and flat)

On a vast, snow-covered plain under a soft gray-blue sky, two fluffy penguin chicks waddle slowly across the snow.
Their tiny bodies wobble with each step, wings slightly flapping for balance.
One pauses and looks back at the other, as if waiting. The second chick quickly waddles forward, catching up with a little hop.
Their feet make light crunching sounds on the snow, leaving two trails of small footprints behind them.
In the distance, icy cliffs and sea mist fade into the horizon, while the focus stays on the gentle companionship of the two chicks.
The scene is quiet, peaceful, and heartwarming‚Äîperfectly matched with soft piano music or ambient wind.


In the glitched-out city park, a man points at the dissolving scenery, his voice filled with a strange mix of fear and vindication. [I told you we were in a simulation!] he shouts. [I was right all along!] He turns to the camera, a wild look in his eyes, as his body flickers and distorts.
